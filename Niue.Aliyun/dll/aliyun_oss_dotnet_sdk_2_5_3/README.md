    {
    	Console.WriteLine(bucket.Name + ", " + bucket.Location + ", " + bucket.Owner);
    }
```
    
#### Create a bucket (Create Bucket)
```csharp
	OssClient client = new OssClient(endpoint, accessKeyId, accessKeySecret);
	client.CreateBucket(bucketName);
```
	
#### Delete a bucket (Delete Bucket)
```csharp
	OssClient client = new OssClient(endpoint, accessKeyId, accessKeySecret); 
	client.DeleteBucket(bucketName);
```

#### Upload a file (Put Object)
```csharp
	OssClient client = new OssClient(endpoint, accessKeyId, accessKeySecret); 
	client.PutObject(bucketName, key, filePathToUpload);
```

#### Download an object (Get Object)
```csharp
	OssClient client = new OssClient(endpoint, accessKeyId, accessKeySecret); 
	var object = ossClient.GetObject(bucketName, key);	
```

#### Get the object list (List Objects)
```csharp
	OssClient client = new OssClient(endpoint, accessKeyId, accessKeySecret);
	var listResult = client.ListObjects(bucketName);
	foreach (var summary in listResult.ObjectSummaries)
	{   
		Console.WriteLine(summary.Key);
	}
```
